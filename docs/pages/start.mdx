# Getting Started

## Installation

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

It is the recommended way to install Gravity.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Gravity as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/pr1mer-tech/Gravity.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```

## Quick Start

For normal RESTful APIs with JSON data, first you need to create a model structure, which represents the expected result:

```swift
struct Landmark: Hashable, Codable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String
    var park: String
    var state: String
    var description: String
}
```

  If you want to process the data manually or have a different type of API, you can create your own fetcher function. 
  Check <Link href="/docs/data-fetching"><a href="/docs/data-fetching">here</a></Link> for more examples.
</Callout>

Then you can import Gravity and start using it inside any view components:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Gravity

struct LandmarkList: View {
    @SWR(url: "https://example.org/api/endpoint", model: Landmark) var api
    var body: some View {
        if let landmarks = api.data {
            List(landmarks, id: \.id) { landmark in
                LandmarkRow(landmark: landmark)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Normally, there're 3 possible states of a request: "loading", "ready", or "error". You can use the value of `data` and `error` to
determine the current state of the request, and return the corresponding UI.

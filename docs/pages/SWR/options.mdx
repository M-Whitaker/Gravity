# API Options
Constructors:
```swift
// Simple JSON Object decoder
@SWR<URL, Model>(url: "https://example.org/api/endpoint", options: SWROptions = .default) // Where Model can be any Codable struct.
// Raw Init - You should use this only if you want to have a custom workflow
@SWR<Key, Value>(key: Key, fetcher: Fetcher<Key, Value>, options: SWROptions = .default) // Where Key is a hashable that can represent the query and Value is the returned object.
```

## Return Values
You'll receive a `StateResponse<Key, Value>` object that has the following properties:
- `data: Value?`: data for the given key resolved by fetcher (or `nil` if not loaded)
- `error: Error?`: error thrown by fetcher (or `nil`)
- `awaiting: Bool`: is the request still happening?
- `revalidate(mutated: Value? = nil, makeRequest: Bool = true)`: function to mutate the cached data

# Gravity

<Features/>

Gravity is a SwiftUI library for remote data fetching. It uses `stale-while-revalidate` technonology to fetch data from the server, a cache invalidation strategy popularized by [HTTP RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861).
Gravity first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.

<Callout emoji="âœ…">
  With Gravity, components will get a stream of data updates <strong>constantly</strong> and <strong>automatically</strong>.
  And the UI will be always <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>reactive</strong>.

## Overview

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Gravity

struct LandmarkList: View {
    @SWR<URL, Landmark>(url: "https://example.org/api/endpoint", model: Landmark) var api
    var body: some View {
        if let landmarks = api.data {
            List(landmarks, id: \.id) { landmark in
                LandmarkRow(landmark: landmark)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the property wrapper `@SWR` accepts a `url` and a `model`.

The `url` is the URL of the API. And the `model` is a `Codable` object.

`api` will be a `StateResponse` object that has three children: `data` that will contain the decoded data, `error` in case there is an error and `awaiting` when the app is loading.

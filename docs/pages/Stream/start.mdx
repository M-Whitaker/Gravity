# Quick Start

For normal WebSockets stream with JSON data, first you need to create a model structure, which represents the expected result:

```swift
struct Coin: Codable {
    var ticker: String
    var price: Double
}
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  If you want to process the data manually or have a WebSocket communicating in a different way, you can create your own data processor.

</Callout>

Then you can import Gravity and start using it inside any view components:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Gravity

struct CoinPrice: View {
    @GravityStream(url: "wss://example.org/api/endpoint", model: Coin) var stream
    var body: some View {
        if let coin = stream.data {
            Text("The price of \(coin.ticker) is \(coin.price)")
        }
    }
}
```

Normally, there're 3 possible states of a request: "loading", "ready", or "error". You can use the value of `data` and `error` to
determine the current state of the request, and return the corresponding UI.

# Process the data
When using Stream, Gravity will fetch and update your views, but you'll need to convert that `Data` into useful objects. Sometimes, Gravity can do that automatically for you if this `Data` can be represented as JSON. But otherwise, you'll be asked to provide a system to encode and decode data.

  To process the data, you'll need to provide the methods to transform the received data into any object.

## Creating a data processor
The first thing you'll want is to subclass `Streamable`, the class that defines the shared behavior that is common to all data processors. Make sure to define the returned type of object when subclassing `Streamable`. In this example, we'll create a very basic data processor that receives data from the socket and convert it as a plain `String`:

```swift
class StringStreamProcessor: Streamable<String> {
    // Override the encode method
    override func encode(value: String) throws -> Data {
        return value.data(using: .utf8)!
    }
    // Override the decode method
    override func decode(message: Data) throws -> String {
        return String(data: message, encoding: .utf8) ?? "None"
    }
}
```

## Using the data processor
Once we've defined our data processor, we can use it simply by passing an instance as an argument in the `GravityStream` property wrapper:
```swift
@GravityStream(url: "wss://example.org/api/endpoint", processor: StringStreamProcessor()) var api
```
